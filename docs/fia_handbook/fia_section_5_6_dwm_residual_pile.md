## 5.6.20 VOLCF

Gross cubic-foot volume of the residual pile. The gross volume, in cubic feet, of the pile, calculated with equations based on shape code and pile dimensions. This is an individual pile value and must be multiplied by one of the piles per acre (PPA) columns to obtain per acre information.

## 5.6.21 DRYBIO

Dry biomass of the residual pile. The oven-dry weight, in pounds, estimated for the pile. This is an individual pile value and must be multiplied by one of the piles per acre (PPA) columns to obtain per acre information.

## 5.6.22 CARBON

Carbon weight of the residual pile. The weight of carbon, in pounds, estimated for the pile. This is an individual pile value and must be multiplied by one of the piles per acre (PPA) columns to obtain per acre information.

## 5.6.23 PPA\_UNADJ

Piles per acre, unadjusted, for population estimates. The number of piles per acre that the pile represents before adjustment for partially nonsampled plots in the stratum. The estimate must be adjusted using factors stored on the POP\_STRATUM table to derive population estimates.

Note: A per acre estimate of the pile is calculated by multiplying PPA\_UNADJ and any pile attribute of interest (e.g., DRYBIO).

## 5.6.24 PPA\_PLOT

Piles per acre, unadjusted, for plot estimates. The number of piles per acre that the pile represents on the individual plot. This estimate is based on the condition area actually sampled on the plot; therefore, it excludes access denied or hazardous conditions. It is used to expand pile attributes for plot-level analyses, where it is important to have an estimate for an individual plot location. This PPA is never adjusted and is not used to derive population estimates.

## 5.6.25 PPA\_COND

Piles per acre, unadjusted, for condition estimates. The number of piles per acre that the pile represents on one condition on the plot. This estimate is based on the condition area actually sampled on the plot, therefore excludes access denied or hazardous conditions. It is used to expand pile attributes for condition-level analyses, where it is important to have an estimate for an individual condition. This PPA is never adjusted and is not used to derive population estimates.
