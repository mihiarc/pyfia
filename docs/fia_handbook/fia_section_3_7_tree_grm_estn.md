This table stores information used to compute net growth, removal, and mortality (GRM) estimates on remeasurement tree records. This includes the detailed land basis, component, estimation type, estimation units, as well as the begin, end, and mid-point diameters and the begin, end, and mid-point estimates. In addition, the standard net growth, removal, and mortality estimates are included, as well as estimates for each individual growth component. Users should note that this table usually includes multiple records for each remeasurement tree. For volume estimates, there are generally three records storing estimates for each estimation type (all live, growing stock, sawlog) for each land basis (forest land or timberland). However, if the estimation type is not applicable to the tree (e.g., the tree is not growing-stock form or is not sawlog size), then there could be only one record for each land basis (all live). Currently, this table only stores GRM estimates for volume.

## 3.7.1 CN

Sequence number. A unique sequence number used to identify a tree GRM estimation record.

## 3.7.2 STATECD

State code. Bureau of the Census Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 2-digit code for each State. Refer to appendix B.

## 3.7.3 INVYR

Inventory year. See SURVEY.INVYR description for definition.

## 3.7.4 PLT\_CN

Plot sequence number. Foreign key linking the GRM tree estimation record to the plot record.

## 3.7.5 TRE\_CN

Tree sequence number. Foreign key linking the GRM tree estimation record to the tree record.

## 3.7.6 LAND\_BASIS

Land basis for estimate. An attribute that categorizes estimates by the land-based domain of interest.

Note: Starting with PLOT.MANUAL ï‚³ 6.0, code descriptions have been modified to match FIA's new definition for accessible forest land and nonforest land. The current wording of "at least 10 percent canopy cover" replaces older wording of "at least 10 percent stocked" as the qualifying criterion in classification. This criterion applies to any tally tree species, including woodland tree species.

| FORESTLAND | Land that has at least 10 percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size or has had at least 10 percent canopy cover of live tally species in the past, based on the presence of stumps, snags, or other evidence. To qualify, the area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between forest and nonforest lands that meet the minimal tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Unimproved roads and trails, streams, and clearings in forest areas are classified as forest if they are less than 120 feet wide or less than an acre in size. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land. |
| TIMBERLAND | Forest land that is producing or capable of producing 20 cubic feet per acre or more per year of wood at culmination of mean annual increment (MAI). Timberland excludes reserved forest lands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## 3.7.11 SUBPTYP\_GRM

## 3.7.12 REMPER

Remeasurement period. The number of years between measurements for remeasured plots to the nearest 0.1 year. This attribute is blank (null) for new plots or remeasured plots that are not used for growth, removals, or mortality estimates.

## 3.7.13 TPAGROW\_UNADJ

Growth trees per acre unadjusted. The number of growth trees per acre that the sample tree theoretically represents based on the sample design. For fixed-radius plots taken with the mapped plot design (PLOT.DESIGNCD = 1), TPAGROW\_UNADJ is set to a constant derived from the plot size. Variable-radius plots were often used in earlier inventories, so the value in TPAGROW\_UNADJ decreases as the tree diameter increases. This attribute will be blank (null) if the tree does not contribute to growth estimates. Based on the procedures described in Bechtold and Patterson (2005), this attribute must be adjusted using factors stored in the POP\_STRATUM table to derive population estimates. Examples of estimating population totals are shown in The Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Population Estimation User Guide.

## 3.7.14 TPAREMV\_UNADJ

Removal trees per acre per year unadjusted. The number of removal trees per acre per year that the sample tree theoretically represents based on the sample design. For fixed-radius plots taken with the mapped plot design (PLOT.DESIGNCD = 1), TPAREMV\_UNADJ is set to a constant derived from the plot size divided by PLOT.REMPER. Variable-radius plots were often used in earlier inventories, so the value in TPAREMV\_UNADJ decreases as the tree diameter increases. This attribute will be blank (null) if the tree does not contribute to removals estimates. Based on the procedures described in Bechtold and Patterson (2005), this attribute must be adjusted using factors stored in the POP\_STRATUM table to derive population estimates. Examples of estimating population totals are shown in The Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Population Estimation User Guide.

## 3.7.15 TPAMORT\_UNADJ

Mortality trees per acre per year unadjusted. The number of mortality trees per acre per year that the sample tree theoretically represents based on the sample design. For fixed-radius plots taken with the mapped plot design (PLOT.DESIGNCD = 1), TPAMORT\_UNADJ is set to a constant derived from the plot size divided by PLOT.REMPER Variable-radius plots were often used in earlier inventories, so the value in TPAMORT\_UNADJ decreases as the tree diameter increases. This attribute will be blank (null) if the tree does not contribute to mortality estimates. Based on the procedures described in Bechtold and Patterson (2005), this attribute must be adjusted using factors stored in the POP\_STRATUM table to derive population estimates. Examples of estimating population totals are shown in The Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Population Estimation User Guide.

## 3.7.16 ANN\_NET\_GROWTH

Average annual net growth estimate. The net change in the estimate per year of this tree. Because this value is net growth, it may be a negative number. Negative values are usually due to mortality but can also occur on live trees that have a net loss because of damage, rot, broken top, or other causes. To expand to a per acre value, multiply by TPAGROW\_UNADJ.

## 3.7.17 REMOVALS

- Â· TREE.DIACHECK = 2 at time 2
- Â· TREE.SPCD observed at time 1 &lt;&gt; TREE.SPCD observed at time 2
- Â· TREE.STATUSCD = 2 and TREE.STANDING\_DEAD\_CD = 1 at time 1 but TREE.STATUSCD = 1 at time 2
