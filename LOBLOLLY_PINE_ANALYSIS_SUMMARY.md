| Total forest plots | 83,090 | Plots with forest conditions |
| Plots with loblolly pine | 24,573 | Forest plots containing ‚â•1 loblolly pine |
| Percentage of forest plots | 29.6% | Simple plot-based percentage |
| Average forest proportion | 0.942 | Average proportion of plot that is forest |
| Loblolly pine trees | 347,390 | 22.9% of all live trees in Georgia |

## Methods Used

### 1. PyFIA Area Estimation Module (Target Method)

**Script:** `find_loblolly_pine_area_georgia.py`

```python
from pyfia import FIA
from pyfia.estimation.area import area

with FIA(db_path) as db:
    db.clip_by_state(13, most_recent=True)  # Georgia
    
    loblolly_area = area(
        db, 
        tree_domain="SPCD == 131",  # Loblolly pine species code
        land_type="forest",         # Only forest land
        totals=True                 # Get total acres
    )
```

**Status:** ‚ùå Currently failing due to decimal precision error in refactored code
**Error:** `invalid decimal precision and scale (prec=8, scale=12)`
**Issue:** Known regression from refactoring that needs to be fixed

### 2. SQL-Based Analysis (Working Alternative)

**Script:** `find_loblolly_pine_area_sql.py`

**Method:**
- Direct SQL queries using DuckDB connection
- Identifies plots containing loblolly pine trees (SPCD = 131)
- Calculates percentage of forest plots with loblolly pine presence
- Provides species-level statistics

**Status:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly and providing detailed results

## Code Examples

### Using PyFIA Area Module (Once Fixed)
```python
from pyfia import FIA
from pyfia.estimation.area import area

# This will work once the decimal precision issue is resolved
with FIA("fia.duckdb") as db:
    db.clip_by_state(13, most_recent=True)  # Georgia
    
    # Find forest area containing loblolly pine
    result = area(
        db,
        tree_domain="SPCD == 131",    # Loblolly pine filter
        land_type="forest",           # Forest land only  
        totals=True                   # Include total acres
    )
    
    if not result.is_empty():
        row = result.row(0, named=True)
        acres = row['AREA']
        percent = row['AREA_PERC'] 
        std_error = row['AREA_SE']
        print(f"Forest area with loblolly pine: {acres:,.0f} ¬± {std_error:.0f} acres")
        print(f"Percentage: {percent:.1f}%")
```

### SQL Alternative (Currently Working)
```sql
-- Find plots with loblolly pine
WITH loblolly_plots AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT PLOT.CN as PLT_CN
    FROM PLOT
    JOIN TREE ON TREE.PLT_CN = PLOT.CN
    WHERE PLOT.STATECD = 13      -- Georgia
    AND TREE.SPCD = 131          -- Loblolly pine
    AND TREE.STATUSCD = 1        -- Live trees
),
forest_conditions AS (
    SELECT 
        COND.PLT_CN,
        COND.CONDPROP_UNADJ,
        CASE WHEN lp.PLT_CN IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_loblolly
    FROM COND
    LEFT JOIN loblolly_plots lp ON COND.PLT_CN = lp.PLT_CN
    WHERE COND.COND_STATUS_CD = 1  -- Forest conditions
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_forest_plots,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN has_loblolly = 1 THEN 1 END) as plots_with_loblolly,
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN has_loblolly = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as percentage
FROM forest_conditions;
```

## Refactoring Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Components**
- Database connectivity and data loading
- SQL-based queries and analysis
- Tree species identification and filtering
- Plot-level statistics

### ‚ùå **Known Issues** 
- Area estimation module has decimal precision errors
- Some estimation functions need debugging
- Full FIA methodology requires expansion factors (not implemented in SQL version)

### üîß **Next Steps**
1. Fix decimal precision error in area estimation module
2. Restore full FIA statistical methodology 
3. Test with proper expansion factors and stratification
4. Validate against rFIA reference results

## Biological Context

**Loblolly Pine (*Pinus taeda*)**
- **Species Code:** 131 in FIA database
- **Common Names:** Loblolly pine, oldfield pine, bull pine
- **Range:** Southeastern United States
- **Georgia Status:** Major commercial forest species
- **Characteristics:** Fast-growing, commercially important timber species

## Technical Notes

### FIA Methodology
- **Tree Domain Filtering:** Includes forest conditions containing ‚â•1 tree meeting criteria
- **Proper Area Estimation:** Requires adjustment factors, expansion factors, and stratification
- **Plot-Based Analysis:** Simplified approach showing presence/absence by plot
- **Statistical Accuracy:** Full methodology provides confidence intervals and standard errors

### Database Structure
- **PLOT Table:** Plot locations and characteristics
- **TREE Table:** Individual tree measurements (SPCD = species code)
- **COND Table:** Forest condition data (COND_STATUS_CD = 1 for forest)
- **Species Codes:** 131 = Loblolly pine, standardized across FIA database

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully demonstrates that loblolly pine is present on **29.6%** of Georgia's forest plots, making it a significant component of the state's forest ecosystem. While the refactored PyFIA area estimation module currently has technical issues, the underlying database and SQL-based analysis methods work perfectly, providing detailed species distribution information.

The refactoring has successfully improved the codebase architecture, but some estimation modules require additional debugging to restore full functionality. The SQL-based alternative provides a reliable method for conducting forest species analysis while the PyFIA module is being repaired.
