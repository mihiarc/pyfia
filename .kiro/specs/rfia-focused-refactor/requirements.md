# Requirements Document

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-07-23)

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the pyFIA project to focus exclusively on programmatic functionality that mimics the rFIA package, removing all AI agent development code and related infrastructure. The goal is to create a clean, focused library that provides Python equivalents to rFIA's core statistical estimation functions for Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 ✅

**User Story:** As a forest analyst, I want a clean Python library that provides rFIA-equivalent functionality, so that I can perform statistical forest inventory analysis without AI agent features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the project SHALL contain only core FIA estimation functionality
2. WHEN users install the package THEN they SHALL NOT have any AI-related dependencies
3. WHEN users import the package THEN they SHALL have access to all rFIA-equivalent functions
4. WHEN the package is used THEN it SHALL maintain exact compatibility with existing rFIA validation results

### Requirement 2 ✅

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all AI agent code backed up and removed from the main codebase, so that the project has a clear, focused scope while preserving the AI work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring begins THEN the AI code SHALL be backed up to a separate location or branch
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the `src/pyfia/ai/` directory SHALL be removed from the main codebase
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the `src/pyfia/cli/ai_interface.py` file SHALL be removed from the main codebase
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all AI-related imports and dependencies SHALL be removed from the main codebase
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all AI-related documentation SHALL be removed or updated
6. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the CLI SHALL only provide direct database query functionality
7. WHEN the backup is created THEN the AI code SHALL be preserved for potential future use

### Requirement 3 ✅

**User Story:** As a user, I want the package installation to be lightweight and focused, so that I don't install unnecessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the package THEN it SHALL NOT require langchain, openai, or other AI-related dependencies
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL only include dependencies needed for FIA data analysis
3. WHEN the pyproject.toml is updated THEN it SHALL remove all AI-related optional dependencies
4. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL have a smaller footprint without AI components

### Requirement 4 ✅

**User Story:** As a forest researcher, I want comprehensive rFIA-equivalent functions, so that I can migrate from R to Python seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the package THEN it SHALL provide biomass(), volume(), tpa(), area(), mortality(), and growth() functions
2. WHEN calling these functions THEN they SHALL accept the same parameter patterns as rFIA equivalents
3. WHEN the functions execute THEN they SHALL produce results that match rFIA validation benchmarks
4. WHEN using temporal estimation methods THEN they SHALL support TI, annual, SMA, LMA, and EMA methods

### Requirement 5 ✅

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean project documentation, so that the focus on rFIA functionality is clear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL remove all AI agent sections and references
2. WHEN the documentation is updated THEN it SHALL focus on rFIA compatibility and validation results
3. WHEN the project description is updated THEN it SHALL emphasize statistical estimation capabilities
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate rFIA-equivalent usage patterns
5. WHEN the docs directory is updated THEN it SHALL remove all AI agent documentation

### Requirement 6 ✅

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a clean CLI interface, so that users can perform direct database operations without AI features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is refactored THEN it SHALL only provide direct database query functionality
2. WHEN users run CLI commands THEN they SHALL NOT see any AI-related options or interfaces
3. WHEN the CLI help is displayed THEN it SHALL only show database and estimation commands
4. WHEN CLI commands are executed THEN they SHALL provide direct access to FIA estimation functions

### Requirement 7 ✅

**User Story:** As a user, I want the core FIA functionality to remain intact, so that my existing analysis workflows continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing FIA estimation functions SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN existing tests are run THEN they SHALL continue to pass without modification
3. WHEN validation benchmarks are checked THEN they SHALL maintain the same accuracy levels
4. WHEN the FIA class is used THEN it SHALL provide the same database interface as before
