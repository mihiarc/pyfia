# FIA Working Query Bank

**⚠️ This file has been reorganized for better maintainability and AI-agent accessibility.**

## 🚀 New Organized Structure

The FIA query collection has been restructured into a modular, category-based organization:

### 📁 **[Main Query Library](./queries/)**

**Browse the complete organized collection:**
- **[🌳 Basic Tree Queries](./queries/basic_tree/)** - Fundamental tree counting and enumeration
- **[🌲 Growth, Removal, and Mortality](./queries/growth_mortality/)** - Complex GRM analysis using TREE_GRM_* tables
- **[🌿 Biomass and Carbon](./queries/biomass_carbon/)** - Species-specific biomass calculations
- **[🌳 Tree Count and Density](./queries/tree_density/)** - Species distribution and TPA analysis
- **[🏛️ Ratio Estimation](./queries/ratio_estimation/)** - Advanced statistical estimation techniques
- **[📊 Volume Analysis](./queries/volume/)** - Merchantable timber volume calculations
- **[🗺️ Forest Area](./queries/forest_area/)** - Land use classification and area estimates

### 📚 **Essential Resources**

- **[🔧 EVALIDator Methodology](./evaluator_methodology.md)** - Oracle EVALIDator translation principles

## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure
